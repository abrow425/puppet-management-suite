                    all code is run in your browser, and any passwords are only

                    <br>
                    No information that you enter is transferred to me (or Auralia).
                    <br>
                    You can check this yourself by reading the source code

					Passwords are required for the base functionality of this web app. This is

					gift out the cards. You wouldn't want someone else gifting your cards out,
